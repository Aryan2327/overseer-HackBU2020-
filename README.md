Scary Advertising HackBU
Created by: Aryan Chaudhary, Ryan Meliti, Tom Gruszecki

Project Description: Uses several python-based libraries such as Facial_recognition and OpenCV in order to create facial recognition through images taken and saved by snapshots, as well to detect the hue of clothing articles. This data is then collected and saved into memory, being used to perform target advertising based on pairing the identity with the color of clothing.

Python Modules required: Face_recognition, OpenCV, Numpy, dlib(long process to install!)
